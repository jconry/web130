        <h2><i>"A little about me..."</i></h2>
        <p>I’m Jennifer…an artist, photographer, designer and writer. I’m in search of moments and inspirations. The way life moves when we slow down enough to be moved by the nuances, the beauty, the details bursting with color, line, feeling. I feel truly alive and with purpose when I am creating, researching, cataloging, seeing, feeling, being.</p>
        <p>I’m a Seattleite, completely enamored with my city and the amazing beauty of the Pacific Northwest. I am inspired everyday by the lush greens, the pops of color on sunny days, the gray quiet that envelops us, sometimes endlessly or so it seems. The smell of the sea and fog horns, poetry on concrete, the ever evolving life on these city streets.</p>
        <p>I am also a Californian. I spent most of my life surrounded by endless summers, amazing evenings where the air is so soft yet full of electricity. That amazing golden hour when the skies begin to turn inky blue, the moon always watching, quietly. A beautiful palette of color in constant bloom and the call of the ocean reminding me to be mindful and breathe.</p>
        <p>I love the differences and similarities of calling two places home. The inspirations of life lived in sun and clouds always filling my soul. That passion than manifests on paper, in ink, paint scraped on canvas, photos snapped as memories, meandering words, stillness and joy.</p>
        <p>P.S. I’m also a Midwestern girl (Iowa). I spent my early childhood there and have many fond memories of those years. It’s when I fell in love with lilacs, rhubarb and grapevines, marching bands, drums and autumn football games, pocket doors and front porches, museums and Japanese gardens, Elvis, vinyl records and vintage cars.</p>
